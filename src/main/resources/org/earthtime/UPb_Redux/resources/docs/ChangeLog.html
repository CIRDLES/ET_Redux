                New menu for creating ID-TIMS samples: use menu ''U-Pb Sample File / New Sample Analysis for ID-TIMS''.
                All ID-TIMS Analysis samples now managed with Workflow Manager that supports Live Workflow for Tripoli 4.6+
                and complete portability of ".redux" files.  Details (refer to actual dialog screen):
                <OL>
                    <li>
                        <b>Introduction:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A sample in U-Pb_Redux is composed of aliquots, or physical pieces of the sample
                                (e.g. a zircon separate), which in turn are composed of fractions, or individual U/Pb analyses.
                                For more information about each, see their entries here, or U-Pb_Redux Help.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To create a new aliquot, type its name in the Aliquot Name dialog box, increment the counter
                                below to the number of fractions it contains (you can add more at any time), and then select
                                ''Add Name''.  Add any number of aliquots in this way, and order them in the data table with the arrows to the left.
                                After entering the requisite information for each fraction, press ''SaveAs Sample With Data Structure''.
                                Navigate to the desired location, then create a new folder for your sample before saving the .redux file inside.
                                U-Pb_Redux will create a sub-folder for each aliquot, populated with empty data files for each Pb and U measurement.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Samples:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A sample is a single collection of a geologic material from one location.  This name is shared by each
                                of the sample's fractions, or U/Pb analyses.  You don’t have to give the .redux file or the folder that
                                contains it the exact same name as the sample.  However, when you export an analysis from Tripoli for Redux,
                                you must provide the sample name correctly, or Redux won’t recognize it.  A sample name may not contain
                                spaces --- use hyphens or underscores instead.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To upload your sample to the GeoChron database, you may request an IGSN, or International Geologic Sample Number,
                                through SESAR ( www.geosamples.org ).  U-Pb_Redux will guide you through this process when you publish from the Aliquot page.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Aliquots:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aliquots are physical pieces of a sample whose dates you wish to interpret separately.  For instance,
                                zircon and titanite mineral separates could be two aliquots.  Pieces of a sample sent to two different labs,
                                or whose mineral separation was performed with two different techniques, would also be two aliquots.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                New aliquots may be added at any time to an existing sample.  In this window, type a new name (over an existing name)
                                in the Aliquot Name dialog box, increment the counter below to number of fractions it contains (you can add more
                                fractions at any time), and then select ''Add Name''.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fractions:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A fraction is a paired U+Pb analysis.  For instance, a zircon analyzed by TIMS or a spot zapped by LA-ICPMS
                                would be separate fractions, even if both analyzed the same grain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To add fractions to this sample, choose an aliquot at left, increment the ''insert fractions'' counter
                                to the desired number of fractions, then click ''Add Fractions''.  Fractions may be removed by clicking
                                the red X on the left side of its row in the table.  If you have already made U/Pb measurements and
                                exported them from Tripoli (as .xml files), you can import them from this window.  Click the ''Import Fraction Files''
                                button, then navigate to and select the analyses you want to import.
                                You can hold control or shift to select multiple .xml files.  If these are the first fractions created for
                                this sample, your sample will automatically be given the name from the imported file.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Live Workflow:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The Live Workflow mode establishes a direct link between Tripoli and U-Pb_Redux. Clicking the ''START Live Workflow''
                                button at the bottom of U-Pb_Redux’s main screen immediately imports data from Tripoli and prompts U-Pb_Redux to
                                update its calculations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To enable Live Workflow, you must create a folder called ''SampleMetaData'' and then click the ''Set SampleMetaData Folder'' button.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Tripoli must also be told the location of this SampleMetaData folder.  In Tripoli, point to this SampleMetaData
                                folder with the ''Set Live Workflow Data Folder'' item from the Control Panel menu.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Manual Update:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Redux can also read in new data files or refresh data from overwritten data files, as long as they are organized
                                into aliquot sub-folders in your sample's folder.  After saving or changing xml files, press the ''Update Data''
                                button at the bottom of the Redux main window.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                While you can import new fractions this way, you must create new
                                aliquots from this window, using the interface at left.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </OL>
            </li>
            <li>
                Oxide correction can now be performed on the corrections tab of an individual fraction.  You are also able to reverse the
                correction (if any) applied by Tripoli.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fraction Notes: the <b>''N'' button</b> beside each fraction name (main screen, top) allows the analyst to keep notes on each fraction.
                The notes can be viewed together on the ''Fraction Notes'' tab of the aliquot editor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Report table shows an entry of '-' when no value exists.  Report table now supports dates in Ma, Ka, and auto-detect modes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Report Settings Models</b> can be saved and imported to customize your experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Publication of aliquots:</b>  U-Pb_Redux supports the publication of aliquots in a standard '.xml' format to a local drive or
                to the Geochron database.  See the aliquot window accessed by clicking on the gray aliquot button on the left of the fractions
                listed on the top of the main U-Pb_Redux window.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Compilation of aliquots:</b>  U-Pb_Redux supports the compilation of aliquots from many sources into a ''Super-Sample'' that
                can be explored using the sample date features including Concordia and weighted means across the compiled sample.   This
                feature is not fully developed, but users are pushing us to do so, so stay tuned. Steps:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Choose menu ''U-Pb Sample File / New Compilation of Aliquots into a ''"Super-Sample'' File.''
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose either the ''Single Local Aliquot'' or the ''Import one or more Aliquots from Geochron database'' option.
                        U-Pb_Redux does not yet support importing from a local folder option.
                        However, you can import multiple local aliquots one-at-a-time by using the menu ''U-Pb Sample File / Manage Sample Model.''
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once you have compiled two or more aliquots, you can use the Sample tab on the sample dates window
                        to explore Concordia and weighted means.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>LA-ICP MS</b> legacy data can now be imported in bulk using .csv files, in a manner similar to that for ID-TIMS data.
                Please note that development continues to incorporate LA-ICP MS - centered interpretative tools into U-Pb_Redux.
                <p>
                Instructions to generate CSV data format for LA-ICP MS:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click menu <b>Tools / Open CSV File of LA-ICP MS Legacy Data Sample Field Names </b> .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your default program for opening CSV files (Often Excel) will open a file called
                        <b>LegacySampleFieldNamesTemplate.csv</b>, ready for you to populate the columns
                        with the appropriate data.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Once you have populated and saved the CSV file, you can import it into U-Pb_Redux.
                <br>
                Follow these steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click menu <b>U-Pb Sample File / New Sample File from Legacy Analysis / LA-ICP MS Legacy Analysis</b> .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click <b>Bulk Mode from CSV File</b> radio button on manager window that pops up.
                        Edit the sample and aliquot names to fit your data and click <b>OK</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Navigate to your CSV file using the file finder window and click <b>Open</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Save your sample (.redux) file in the folder of your choice and click <b>Save</b>.
                        Your reduced data appears in the data table in the bottom half of U-Pb_Redux.
                        To view / edit your data, click on one of the grey Aliquot buttons in the top
                        frame of U-Pb_Redux.  Note that the table at top displays blanks for any
                        missing ratio data.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Added bulk import of legacy ID-TIMS data.  Drew Coleman suggested this feature in May 2009.
                To keep the architecture as open
                as possible, U-Pb_Redux will import CSV (comma separated values) files.  These
                CSV files are easily opened and exported by all versions of Excel, Google Spreadsheets,
                OpenOffice.org, etc.  To begin, U-Pb_Redux automatically writes 
                and opens a CSV file with the appropriate column headings  NOTE: the
                headings are for your information only and are not parsed (so you can change them)
                -- the only requirement is that the order of the data fields remain the same.
                <br><br> These are: Fraction, 206/238, 2-sig%, 207/235, 2-sig%, 207/206, 2-sig%, rho 6/38-7/35,
                206/204, 208/206, Pb*/Pbc, Pb* pg, Pbc pg, conc U, conc Pb, Th/U samp, frac mass, age206/238,
                2-sig, age207/235, 2-sig, age207/206, 2-sig, age206/238xTh, 2-sig, age207/235xPa, 2-sig,
                age207/206xTh, 2-sig, 207/206xPa, 2-sig
                <br><br>
                Instructions to generate CSV data format:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click menu <b>Tools / Open CSV File of ID-TIMS Legacy Data Sample Field Names </b> .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your default program for opening CSV files (Often Excel) will open a file called
                        <b>LegacySampleFieldNamesTemplate.csv</b>, ready for you to populate the columns
                        with the appropriate data.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                Once you have populated and saved the CSV file, you can import it into U-Pb_Redux.
                <br>
                Follow these steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click menu <b>U-Pb Sample File / New Sample File from Legacy Analysis / ID-TIMS Legacy Analysis</b> .
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click <b>Bulk Mode from CSV File</b> radio button on manager window that pops up.
                        Edit the sample and aliquot names to fit your data and click <b>OK</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Navigate to your CSV file using the file finder window and click <b>Open</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Save your sample (.redux) file in the folder of your choice and click <b>Save</b>.
                        Your reduced data appears in the data table in the bottom half of U-Pb_Redux.
                        To view / edit your data, click on one of the grey Aliquot buttons in the top
                        frame of U-Pb_Redux.  Note that the table at top displays blanks for any
                        missing ratio data.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                Updated Aliquot tab to show Estimated Date (was age) as ''###0.0''.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improved the <b>U-Pb Sample File</b> menu so that up to 10 files show in menu item <b>Recent Sample Files ...</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added persisent state for the folder containing the current Sample file (.redux) so that menu item
                <b>U-Pb Sample File / Open Sample File</b> will access this folder automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed Fraction ratio data table (upper half of U-Pb_Redux main view) to use
                a check box to toggle the selction of fractions used in the analysis.  Previously,
                the user clicked on fraction rows to do the same thing, but it was generally regarded as clunky.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed WeightMeansChooser window in sample date interpretations to size itself
                to contain all the aliquots.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refined button architecture at bottom of main window.
            </li>
            <li>
                Report Table (bottom window main U-Pb_Redux window)
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Corrected tabulated data table (bottom of U-Pb_Redux main window) response to scroll-wheels:
                        eliminated ''crawling''.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Revised report table to use three rows of column headings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added new category of Correlation Coefficients to Report Settings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refined column headings and footnotes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repaired Excel reports built from Report Settings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Made report table sensitive to whether all included fractions have the same value for
                        initial fraction activity ratio [231Pa]/[235U] and for Th/U[magma].  If not, then the
                        cooresponding column appears in the Composition category listing the values by fraction
                        and the corresponding footnote is modified to alert the reader.
                        If the values are all the same, the column disappears and the standard footnote appears.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added units choosers for mass and concentrations.  For dates, the units are
                        automatically ''Ma'' if any included fraction's 206/238 date > 1,000,000.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set default report settings that you can modify and save through the reports menu item.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        REMINDER: Using the report settings menu, you can customize the report layout and number formatting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added a customizable second Fraction name column.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            </li>
            <li>
                Added funding info to About box.
            </li>
