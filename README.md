ET_Redux
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CIRDLES/ET_Redux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CIRDLES/ET_Redux)

**ET_Redux** is the flagship cyber infrastructure product of [CIRDLES](http://cirdles.org),
the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences, 
an undergraduate research
lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. **ET_Redux** was 
previously known as U-Pb_Redux, but in January of 2015, was renamed to
reflect its expanding functionality and its sponsor, EARTHTIME (EARTH-TIME.org).

**ET_Redux** currently serves the ID-TIMS and LAICP-MS U-Pb geochronology communities
as described [here](http://cirdles.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/ggge1933.pdf) and 
[here](http://cirdles.org/sites/default/files/Downloads/ggge1932.pdf).

We have recently received NSF funding to extend the architecture to Uranium series
analyses, as explained 
[here](http://earthcube.org/group/cyberinfrastructure-u-series-geochronologic-data). 

As of March 2015, we are migrating our content from CIRDLES.org to this site, with
the goal of stimulating community involvement.
