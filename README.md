**Note:**
We encourage you to download
and evaluate the latest release, the ".jar" file found <a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/ET_Redux/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.  
ET_Redux requires Oracle's <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank">Java 1.8</a>.  Java 1.9 and 1.10 are no longer supported and Java 1.11 through 1.17 involve major architectural changes that we have elected to avoid until 2024-2025.  You can read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history) about the community's plans for Java.

**UPDATE JAN 2021**
[Liberica OpenJDK 8](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#/java-8-lts) also works: be sure to download the "full jre" or "full jdk".

**ET_Redux** is the flagship cyber infrastructure product of [CIRDLES](http://cirdles.org),
the Cyber Infrastructure Research and Development Lab for the Earth Sciences, 
an undergraduate research
lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina. **ET_Redux** was 
previously known as U-Pb_Redux, but in January of 2015, was renamed to
reflect its expanding functionality and its sponsor, EARTHTIME (EARTH-TIME.org).

**ET_Redux** currently serves the ID-TIMS and LAICP-MS U-Pb geochronology communities.

We have recently received NSF funding to extend the architecture to Uranium series
analyses, as explained 
[here](http://earthcube.org/group/cyberinfrastructure-u-series-geochronologic-data). 

As of March 2015, we are migrating our content from CIRDLES.org to this site, with
the goal of stimulating community involvement.
